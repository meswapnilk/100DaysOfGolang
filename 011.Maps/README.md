# Differences between Maps and Structs

Map | Struct
---|---
All keys must be the same type 
Use to repesent a collection of related properties | Use to represent a "thing" with a lot of different properties
All Values must be of the same type | Values can be of different type
Don't need to know all the keys at the compile time | Need to know all the different fields at compile time
Keys are indexed - we can iterate over them | Keys don't support indexing
Reference Type! | Value Type!
